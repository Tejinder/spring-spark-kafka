# spark-kafka
This project demonstrates the integration between Apache Spark and Apache Kafka

# Apache-Spark
Spark Streaming is part of the Apache Spark platform that enables scalable, high throughput, fault tolerant processing of data streams.

# Apache-Kafka
Apache Kafka is a scalable, high performance, low latency platform that allows reading and writing streams of data like a messaging system.
